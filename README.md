**Fruitpacker** (or *zekkie's fruitpacker*) is a tiny little Python project I made that auto extracts drum kit files from .zips into FL Studio. I basically made this since I'm both a programmer and a music producer, and lazy too :P

# Download Fruitpacker
You can download **Fruitpacker** for Windows (*64 & 32Bit*) and macOS [here](https://zekkie.dev/fruitpacker.html).

# How Fruitpacker works
It's pretty simple - Setup might take a bit of time, but it'll all be worth it in the end.

**Upon installation and first time launching**, Fruitpacker will ask you to locate where you keep all your samples (like *808s*, *Hi-Hats*, *Snares*, etc.). You'll have to assign each folder separately so the program knows what goes where. Once done, it'll save and remember everything in a little *.txt* file saved on your computer (located in C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Fruitpacker\.) If you want to make any changes (whether it be moved folders or a new type available), just click on the top > 'Settings' > 'Change Folder Settings'. 

When setup is done, just drag and drop a drum kit .zip file into the program, sit back and relax. Everything is done for you! Give it a few minutes though, depending on how good your computer's CPU is :3.
