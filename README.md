**Fruitpacker** (or *zekkie's fruitpacker*) is a tiny little Python project I made that auto extracts drum kit files from .zips into FL Studio. I basically made this since I'm both a programmer and a music producer, and lazy too :P

# Download Fruitpacker
You can download **Fruitpacker** for Windows (*64 & 32Bit*) and macOS [here](https://zekkie.dev/fruitpacker.html).

# How Fruitpacker Works
It's pretty simple - Setup might take a bit of time, but it'll all be worth it in the end.

**Upon launching**, you'll have to go to Settings > Preferences and set your respective folders for your files.

When setup is done, just click on "Select Compressed File", select your **.zip/.7z** file, press on "Extract and Sort", sit back and relax. Everything is done for you! Give it a few seconds though, depending on how good your computer's CPU is :3.

# Contribute to Fruitpacker
